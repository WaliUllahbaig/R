This project, titled offers a comprehensive analysis of product and customer data for a retail company. Through meticulous data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA), 
we extracted valuable insights to inform business strategies and enhance customer engagement. Key findings include the identification of top-performing products, customer 
purchasing patterns, and the impact of discounts on sales. By leveraging visualizations such as bar charts, line graphs, and density plots, we made the complex data understandable, 
highlighting trends and anomalies that can guide decision-making. The analysis revealed critical insights, such as the most sought-after products, peak buying times, and geographical 
hotspots for sales. This dashboard serves as a crucial tool for stakeholders to track business performance, understand customer behavior, and tailor marketing efforts to meet market 
demands effectively, thereby driving growth and improving customer satisfaction.
