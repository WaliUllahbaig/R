# Tasks
Perform EDA to come up with questions use you can answer using this data. 

1. Analyze the products data
   Answer questions like:
    - Which company has the most products?
    - Which company has the most expensive products?
    - Additional insights you can find in the data
  
2. Analyze the customer data
   Answer questions like:
    - Which customer has the most orders?
    - Which customer has the most expensive orders?
    - Which city has the most orders?
    - Which city has spent the most?  
    - Identify patterns in addresses. Are there any areas more affluent per city?
    - Are any customers businesses?
    - Will clustering give any useful insights? Try and find out.
    - Additional insights you can find in the data

Note: Please specify questions you have attempted to answer. A good rule of thumb would be at least 5 questions per csv.

# Expectations
Work on your presentation. Create graphs to make your results easy to understand. E.g. create a bar chart to show the number of products per company. The axis must be properly labeled. A legend must be present. An appropriate title must be present. But do not overdo it and spend too time on just the presentation. Focus on getting the analysis done and then work on the presentation.

# Criteria
- Explain your findings and methodology 
  - Explain the code you wrote (in comments)
  - Explain why you chose this specific approach
  - Explain the results you found
- Are any visualizations clearly annotated and easy to understand?
- Is the code well-organized and easy to follow? Are your results easy to replicate for someone else?
- What did your analysis miss? How can it be improved?
- What would you do differently if you had more time?
