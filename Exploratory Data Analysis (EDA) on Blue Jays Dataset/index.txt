This R script conducts an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Blue Jays dataset. The code utilizes the readr and ggplot2 packages to read the dataset and 
create informative visualizations. Four key questions (Question-01 to Question-04) are addressed, exploring relationships between body mass and head length, 
considering factors like sex and positive attributes. The visualizations include scatter plots, density plots, and regression lines, providing insights into 
the dataset's characteristics. The code showcases effective data visualization techniques for understanding the distribution and relationships within the Blue 
Jays dataset.
